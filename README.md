The goal of this repo is to demonstrate different visualisation
techniques for communicating information about transport networks.

# 1 Example data

Weâ€™ll use a route network dataset from the Propensity to Cycle Tool
(PCT) to demonstrate the package. The PCT is a web application that
allows users to explore cycling potential across England and Wales. The
PCT is available at [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/).

A simple visualisation of the data in a multi-panel static map is shown
below.
